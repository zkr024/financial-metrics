# financial-metrics

- The app takes information from the [Financial Modeling Prep API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs).
- To get basic information I first ran the end point Financial Statement Symbol.
- To filter companies I based from the forber article [The Global 2000](https://www.forbes.com/lists/global2000/?sh=4cd60b605ac0)
- The API doesn't give access to some of the companies on that list. I end up chossing 30 to render the front screen.
- A local array was created with the basic information:
  > Company name.

  > Symbol.

  > Image.
- The images were taken from the companies sites
- To access the company details I used the end point Income Statement. It works with the company symbol.
- Based on Nelson [Sakwa on Behance](https://www.behance.net/sakwadesignstudio) design.
